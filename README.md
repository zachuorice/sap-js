# Super Audio Player
## Introduction
Super Audio Player, or SAP, is a jquery plugin for adding an html5 audio player UI to any page. This player offers play/pause functionality, a bar representing the current time in the track, ability to seek in the track using this bar, support for a playlist of tracks. This is achieved through HTML, CSS, and Javascript only.

## Principles
SAP-js strives to be feature-complete, bug-free, and flexible. In addition when possible all information about tracks in the player will be specified in HTML only. Same thing for styling, all styling will be through CSS only.

## Example
See test/sap\_jquery.html for a usage example.

## Version History
### Release 1
This release is more of a prototype, styling on the player isn't very good or consistent yet, but it is somewhat functional.

Also not well-tested, so probably buggy.

## TODO/Reminders
### v2
* More consistent and modern player style
* Theme-able player style
* Better unit tests
* Support for annotations on tracks by timestamp
* Better expandable track information frame
